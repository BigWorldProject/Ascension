"海尔达利发现与<CHARNAME>在一起的冒险旅程是对遗忘国土的人们吟唱的最好故事题材了，而在离开<CHARNAME>所率领的队伍后他还想见识更大的世界。他旅行经过了许多的地方，包括深水城，无冬城，还有萨尔，旅途中他传诵着<CHARNAME>的传奇故事...然而不知何故他总是处在传奇的中心位置．而每次旅行的结果几乎都是无端卷入当地的风波然后仓皇出逃。尽管说这位吟游诗人承认他只是了解一小部分其他位面居民的怪癖，但他还是渴望去其他位面旅游。后来他遇上了一位女性黑暗骑士，并与她一起回到了深渊，并因无意间领导了地狱中的几场叛乱而结束地狱之旅。后来，在谈到这件事时他常常会笑起来：他强迫恶魔领主格拉兹特坐到谈判桌前，这对恶魔来说这是一个滑稽且尴尬的位置，然而他从未就此事给过一个肯定或否定的回答。尽管他是多个位面的通缉犯，但敌人的愤怒追捕丝毫没有减少他对于流浪生活的爱好，最后他终于毫发无伤地回到了印记城。在那里他又加入了瑞伊斯的剧团，并从此安顿下来，当然可能的话，他还是盼望着能有下一次“不幸的旅行”。"
