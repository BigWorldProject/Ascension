"Lame du Chaos de Sarevok\n"
"Il s'agit de l'arme de Sarevok, frère de <CHARNAME>, qui fut utilisée dans la bataille de la Porte de Baldur. <CHARNAME> a gagné, ruinant ainsi les plans de Sarevok, et sauvant la Côte des Epées de la guerre. Maintenant, Sarevok s'est joint à la cause de <CHARNAME> et son épée lui a été rendue. Sarevok décrit cette arme comme une Lame Fatale et a restauré une partie des anciens pouvoirs de cet objet. Cependant, sans son essence d'Enfant de Bhaal pour nourrir l'épée, il n'a pu lui rendre la totalité du pouvoir qu'elle possédait autrefois. Quoiqu'il en soit, elle reste une arme formidable... et Sarevok prévient qu'elle deviendrait très difficile à utiliser dans les mains de quelqu'un qui ne fût pas un Porteur de Mort, voire impossible à utiliser.\n"

"son obsession l'idée d'atteindre à nouveau une telle grandeur. Les gens à "
"travers la Côte des Epées apprirent à craindre Bodhi ; alors qu'elle se "
"baignait dans leur sang et satisfaisait sa soif de mort et de chaos. Les "
"villages commencèrent à se vider de leurs habitants, assaillis par cette "

" temples tentèrent en vain de la chasser. Nombre de puissants clercs furent "
"retrouvés vidés de leur sang, une horrible agonie fixée sur leurs visages "

"elle. Le désespoir et la peur s'inscrivant dans son corps. Son désir pour le"
" chaos s'évanouit et elle lutta pour survivre une fois de plus. L'ambition, "
"qui lui avait fait chuchoter des rêves de gloire à l'oreille de son frère, "
"la ramenait maintenant vers le lieu qu'elle avait autrefois appelé son "
"foyer, Suldanessellar. Ce fût aux portes qu'Ellesime l'accueillit. Aux "
"portes que Bohdi dansa pour la dernière fois. La vengeance brûlait au plus "
"profond de chacune d'entre elles et appelait le sang. Le pouvoir de l'Arbre "
"de Vie avait attiré Bodhi, et la mémoire de Joneleth hurlait dans celle d' "
"Ellesime. Les deux s'enlacèrent et ce fut la vengeance qui l'emporta tandis "
"qu'un pieu perçait le coeur noir de Bodhi, qui avait été autant damnée dans "
"la vie que dans la mort."
