<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Mass Healing (Necromancy)
Range: Sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30 foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

When using this ability, the Bhaalspawn must picture the faces of <PRO_HISHER> fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion, all party members within 30 foot radius of the caster are healed 2d8 + 2/level hit points. Other conditions suffered by the party are cured, as well: fatigue, poison, disease, blindness and deafness.~
@2001 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Regeneration (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful ability enables the Bhaalspawn to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature affected will regain 3 hit points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per every 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th level character would regenerate 18 hit points per round for 7 rounds.~
@2002 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Draw Upon Holy Might (Invocation) 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

The Bhaalspawn calls upon the might of <PRO_HISHER> blood to grant him power for a short period. When <PRO_HESHE> does this, <PRO_HISHER> strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A third level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 1, while a 12th level caster would have all <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 4.~
@2003 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Dark Taint (Necromancy) 
Range: 20 feet
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Through this spell, the Bhaalspawn can expel the taint of <PRO_HISHER> evil sire onto a victim, poisoning those who fail their save vs. death. The effects depend upon the caster's level and are detailed below:
7-9th level: 2d8 + 2/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
10-12th level: 3d8 + 3/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
13-14th level: 4d8 + 4/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
15-16th level: 6d8 + 5/round, slow for 24 seconds, save at -2
17-21st level: 8d8 + 6/round, slow for 24 seconds, save at -4
25th level: 8d8 + 6/round, slow for 36 seconds, save at -4, affects group of targets~
@2004 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained permanent negative plane protection (i.e., <CHARNAME> cannot be level-drained) and 5% magic resistance.~
@2005 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Hand of Murder (Necromancy) 
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 rounds/5 levels
Casting Time: 1
Saving Throw: none 

When this power is called upon by the Bhaalspawn, <PRO_HESHE> immediately does extra damage with each hit to <PRO_HISHER> target with any melee weapon desired (whether it be fist or sword). <PRO_HISHER> dark energies travel through <PRO_HISHER> weapon to assault <PRO_HISHER> victim, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to absorb that damage as healing to <PRO_HIMHER>self.
The effects vary by level as follows:
10th: 2 rounds, 4 hp extra damage, 4 hp healed
15th: 3 rounds, 6 hp extra damage, 6 hp healed
20th: 4 rounds, 8 hp extra damage, 8 hp healed
25th: 5 rounds, 10 hp extra damage, 10 hp healed
30th: 6 rounds, 12 hp extra damage, 12 hp healed~
@2006 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Resurrection (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature Touched
Saving Throw: None

Like the 5th level spell Raise Dead, Resurrection will return a character back to life. However, Resurrection also heals the character so that they are ready for the adventuring life once more.~
@2007 = ~Bhaalspawn Powers

<CHARNAME> has gained 25% resistance to physical damage (i.e., slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage).~
@2008 = ~Habilidade de mudança do Assassino melhorada~
@3000 = ~Espada do Caos do Sarevok +4~
@3001 = ~The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war. Now Sarevok has joined with <CHARNAME>'s cause and his blade has been restored to him. Sarevok describes the weapon as a Deathbringer blade and has restored some of the weapon's old power. Without his Bhaalspawn essence to channel through the sword, however, it cannot achieve the power it once had. Still, however, it is a formidable weapon... and one that Sarevok warns would become increasingly difficult to wield in the hands of one who was not a Deathbringer, if they could use it at all.
