@591 = ~You don't have all the essence of Bhaal... not by far. And I rule here, as well... you know that.~
@605 = ~True. More insightful than I would have expected from you, <CHARNAME>. And far more clever for you to have denied me Balthazar's essence... although, to tell the truth, I was secretly hoping for him to have defeated you. Unlikely as that was, considering the pathetic monk could barely see the forest for the trees.~
@613 = ~Ahhhh, Balthazar is here as well. How clever to deny me his essence, <CHARNAME>. Still blinded by your devotion to destiny, Balthazar? Or have you abandoned your faith so quickly?~
@614 = ~Oh no? Perhaps you do not understand. This... this place, here, is the Source. This is where the essence of all of Bhaal's children returns when they die, hidden away. Did you never wonder, dear Balthazar, what killing all the other spawn of Bhaal was *for*?~
@615 = ~And well you should not have, though you aided me regardless. Bhaal may, indeed, be... somewhere. But not here. Here I have locked these essences away and drank heartily of their power. The Source, the Throne, all are mine... and god-hood is but one simple step away.~
@1002 = ~<CHARNAME> does not stand alone, Melissan. It is time that this is ended.~
@1003 = ~I see well enough now, priestess. Speak clever wit if you wish, you cannot hope to defeat us.~
@1004 = ~To return the essence to our father. And great bloodshed in his name to call him forth. And I never believed it.~
