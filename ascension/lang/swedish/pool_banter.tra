@91 = ~Goodbye, brother. Your self-destructive ways have cost you dearly. You were a fool to oppose such power and I will not suffer in the Abyss with you this time.~
@92 = ~It would seem our prey intends to cower inside the magics of this place, <CHARNAME>. I have no patience for her games. I will have my soul!~
@93 = ~These pools around us have the stench of magic, if we sever their connection to Melissan she will be forced to confront us. This is the realm of all Bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME> - your blood will serve you well.~
@396 = ~With the initial battle now over, you consider your options. In the stream of energy within the center of the Throne, Melissan appears to be invulnerable to harm... and growing in power every second. She must be drawn out willingly in order to defeat her.~
@397 = ~The only option you can think of seem to be regarding the three 'essence pools' that adjoin the Throne. Your own link to the essence might allow you to cut off the flow of energy to Melissan from these pools, forcing her to fight. The pools are, however, likely to be guarded...~
@1005 = ~We must be careful now, <CHARNAME>. Within that stream of energy, Melissan is invulnerable to harm... and I doubt she will come out of it willingly to face us.~
@1006 = ~I think the essence pools that adjoin the Throne might be divertable by someone with a connection to the essence. A Bhaalspawn, one of us. If all three were cut off from her stream, Melissan might be forced to deal with us rather than soak up even more power.~
@1007 = ~She has, no doubt, guarded the pools in some fashion... but it is the only way to continue that I can think of. Short of standing here and watching her become a goddess, that is.~
